## 🌟 Overview

**RoboLearn** turns traditional classrooms into future-ready STEM labs. It bundles together everything a school needs to run a Robotics/AI/IoT program — from an **AI-powered consultant** that answers curriculum and lab-setup questions, to **role-based dashboards** for Admins, Schools, Teachers, and Students, to a **certificate verification system**, **support ticketing**, and a **student innovation showcase**.

It's built as a single full-stack MERN application with a clean, futuristic **dark navy / electric blue / cyan** design language.

## 🧩 System Design

### High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Client - React + Vite<br/>Tailwind CSS UI"] -->|HTTPS / REST API| B["Express.js Server"]
    B --> C["JWT Auth Middleware"]
    C --> D["Route Controllers"]
    D --> E[("MongoDB Atlas")]
    D --> F["AI Consultant Service<br/>(LLM API)"]
    D --> G["Certificate / QR Service"]
    B --> H["Cloud Storage<br/>(images, uploads)"]
    A -->|Deployed on| I["Vercel"]
    B -->|Deployed on| J["Render / Railway"]
```

### Request Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User (Browser)
    participant F as React Frontend
    participant API as Express API
    participant Auth as JWT Middleware
    participant DB as MongoDB

    U->>F: Interacts (login, form, dashboard)
    F->>API: REST request + JWT token
    API->>Auth: Verify token & role
    Auth-->>API: Authorized
    API->>DB: Query / Mutate data
    DB-->>API: Result
    API-->>F: JSON response
    F-->>U: Render updated UI
```

### Role-Based Access Model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Admin["👑 Admin"] --> M1["Manage Schools, Users, Curriculum,<br/>Certificates, Competitions, Content"]
    School["🏫 School"] --> M2["Dashboard, Training Progress,<br/>Certificates, Support Tickets"]
    Teacher["👨‍🏫 Teacher"] --> M3["Training Resources,<br/>Student Progress"]
    Student["🎓 Student"] --> M4["Curriculum, Challenges,<br/>Project Submission, Certificates"]
```

**Design principles:**
- **Separation of concerns** — frontend (React/Vite) is fully decoupled from the backend (Express REST API).
- **Stateless auth** — JWT tokens carry role claims; every protected route is guarded by middleware, not client-side checks alone.
- **Single source of truth** — MongoDB stores users, schools, curriculum, certificates, and tickets as normalized collections.
- **Extensibility** — the AI consultant and certificate/QR system are built as independent services so they can be swapped or scaled separately from the core API.
